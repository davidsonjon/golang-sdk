## About the project

This repository contains the complete build, with assets, for the SailPoint Golang SDK. 
The Golang SDK allows you to use Golang to interact with the SailPoint APIs and other resources to customize and extend your SailPoint platform. 

## Documentation

## Contributing 

The SailPoint Developer Relations Team is always actively working to improve the SailPoint Golang SDK to make it as useful as possible to the SailPoint Developer Community. 
This means adding and maintaining new resources and functionalities for the SDK.
The most valuable resource of all, however, is the community itself! 
We greatly appreciate any input, feedback, and direct contributions you can provide to the Golang SDK, big or small.
