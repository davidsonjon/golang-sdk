# Contribute to the SailPoint Golang SDK

The SailPoint Developer Relations Team is always actively working to improve the SailPoint Golang SDK to make it as useful as possible to the SailPoint Developer Community. 
This means adding and maintaining new resources and functionalities for the SDK.
The most valuable resource of all, however, is the community itself! 
We greatly appreciate any input, feedback, and direct contributions you can provide to the Golang SDK, big or small. 
And we want to make the process of contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible. 

This document will detail the different ways that you can contribute to the community. 

These are the main ways that you can contribute: 
- [Report issues](#report-issues)
- [Request new features](#request-new-features)
- [Submit a fix](#submit-a-fix)
- [Submit a new feature](#submit-a-new-feature)

## How we use GitHub 

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and manage contributions with pull requests. 

This project is open source, which means that it's publicly accessible, allowing anyone who comes across it to view, share, and improve its source code. 

## GitHub flow and pull requests 

The best way to propose changes to the codebase is to use pull requests, and [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) is our preferred method of accepting pull requests. 

This is the basic GitHub flow we use for direct contributions to the codebase: 

1. Fork the repository and create your own branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes in your `main` branch.
3. Push the changes to the repository's `main` branch.
4. Create your pull request! 
5. SailPoint Developer Relations team members will review your pull request and merge it in! 

## GitHub Issues

We use [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to publicly track bugs and feature requests. 

## Report issues 

You may encounter bugs and incorrect or outdated information when you explore the Golang SDK. 
We appreciate your help in identifying bugs of all sizes, from broken links or typos to major issues preventing you from using a resource. 

We use GitHub issues to track bugs publicly. If you see an issue with the SDK, please [report it here](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/golang-sdk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug-report.md&title=%5BBug%5D+Your+Bug+Report+Here). 

We love thorough bug reports. 
The more details you include, the faster we can troubleshoot and fix the issue. 
Great bug reports include these details:

1. A summary of the issue 
2. The steps we can take to reproduce the issue 
    - Be as specific as you can when you describe these steps.
    - Give us sample code if you can. 
3. What you expect to happen
4. What actually happens 
5. Screenshots
6. The operating system you were using when you encountered the issue 
7. The browser you were using when you encountered the issue 
8. Notes 
    - If you have an idea, tell us why you think the issue may be occurring, or what you think we should do to resolve it. 
    - Whatever you tried that didn't work. 
    - Anything else you think might be useful to us. 

## Request new features

Many of our most valuable resources originate in ideas suggested by the community! 
You may have an idea that will improve the site. 
We would love to hear it and possibly implement it! 

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests. Please use [this template](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/golang-sdk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature-request.md&title=%5BFeature%5D+Your+Feature+Request+Here) when you request a new feature.

We love thorough feature requests. 
The more details you include, the faster we can implement your request. 
Great feature requests include these details: 

1. Tell us whether this feature is related to a problem. 
    - If it is, describe the problem. 
2. Describe your desired solution. 
3. Describe alternative solutions you may use yourself or other solutions you may have considered. 
4. Notes 
    - If possible, include how you think this solution would benefit others. 
    - Anything else you think might be useful to us. 

## Submit a fix

One of the main benefits of making our project open source is that it makes it possible for the community to contribute to the Golang SDK directly.
We will always respond as quickly as we can to any issues you report, but if you know how to fix an issue, the fastest way to get it fixed is to submit a pull request and make the fix yourself! 
If you can do this, it's tremendously helpful to us in our efforts to improve the community, and, if you're interested, you will receive ambassador points for your fix.
Check out the [ambassador program](https://developer.sailpoint.com/discuss/t/getting-started-as-a-developer-community-ambassador/11665) to learn more.

To submit a fix, follow these steps: 
1. Fork the repository and copy the `main` branch. 
2. Pull the latest code and ensure that it's running properly. 
3. Create a new branch from main. 
    - Follow this naming convention for your branch: `fix/your-fix-name`
4. Create a pull request from your branch to our origin repository's `main` branch! 

Once you create the pull request, the SailPoint Developer Relations Team will be tagged. 
Someone will then review the pull request and merge it in! 

:::note

Some files in the Golang SDK are auto-generated, so you cannot directly make changes to them (your changes would be overwritten). 
These are the auto-generated files you cannot modify: 

- The 'beta' folder containing the Beta API specifications
- The 'cc' folder containing the CC API specifications
- The 'v2' folder containing the V2 API specifications 
- The 'v3' folder containing the V3 API specifications

## Submit a new feature

We will always respond to your feature requests and implement them as soon as we can. 
However, if you have an idea for a new feature and know how to implement it yourself, the fastest way to add the feature is to submit a pull request and add the feature yourself! 
If you can do this, we greatly appreciate it, and other community members will benefit from your contribution! 
And if you're interested, you will receive ambassador points for your feature contribution.

## Report general issues 

It's possible that none of the options listed here will properly address your issue. 
If you have a general issue, you can submit a general issue by using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/golang-sdk/issues). 
Add as much detail as you can to your issue, and we will address it as quickly as we can. 

## Discuss on the forum

What makes the SailPoint Developer Community great is its brilliant, knowledgeable members!
If you have a question, problem, or idea, one of the best ways to get answers or resolutions is to go to the [Developer Community Forum](https://developer.sailpoint.com/discuss) to discuss them directly with the community on the forum. 
The SailPoint Developer Relations Team, the community ambassadors, and other members will be there to discuss them with you.
And once you're there, you can help others on the forum too!
If you're interested, you will receive ambassador points for the issues you help others resolve on the forum.Check out the [ambassador program](https://developer.sailpoint.com/discuss/t/getting-started-as-a-developer-community-ambassador/11665) to learn more.
